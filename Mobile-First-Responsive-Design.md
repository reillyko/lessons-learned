[Mobile-First Responsive Design](http://responsivedesign.is/strategy/page-layout/mobile-first)

Mobile-First Responsive Design is a really smart way to approach web development. Mobile is obviously a huge priority, but designing a mobile app can cost triple what a website costs, and it's much harder to update. Mobile-First design allows you to build a website that looks great on a phone so you can still capture mobile users. Once you get certain scale and critical mass, then you can think about a true mobile app.

For companies who have already developed a website and can't do mobile-first, there are some work-arounds like Phone Gap that are a cheap way of taking a webpage and bundling it as an app. This can be done in ~4 days. It doesn't look as great as going native or mobile first, but it is an alternative for companies that don't have the ability to do mobile-first nor the budget to go native.

One thing to consider is that when e-commerce is involved, mobile-first doesn't store credit card/shipping information, which could lead to a negative user experience if customers always have to input such information. Be sure to tailor your design and development to the kind of website you want in order to optimize results.
